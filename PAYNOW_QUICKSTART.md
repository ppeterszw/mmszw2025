## üì± Test with Real PayNow

### Using Sandbox (Recommended for Development)
Currently configured to use sandbox mode in development. The system automatically detects `NODE_ENV=development` and uses:
```
https://sandbox.paynow.co.zw
```

### Switching to Production
When ready for production, set:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
```
The system will automatically use:
```
https://www.paynow.co.zw
```

## üîç What Happens Behind the Scenes

### 1. Payment Initiation
```typescript
POST /api/payments/create
{
  "amount": 100,
  "purpose": "membership",
  "paymentMethod": "paynow_ecocash",
  "phoneNumber": "+263771234567",
  "email": "member@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payment": {
    "id": "pay-xxx",
    "paymentNumber": "EACZ-PAY-xxx",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  "paynow": {
    "pollUrl": "https://...",
    "instructions": "Check your phone..."
  }
}
```

### 2. Payment Processing
- System creates payment record in database
- Calculates 2.5% processing fee
- Sends request to PayNow
- PayNow sends mobile prompt (express) or returns redirect URL (web)
- User completes payment on phone or web
- PayNow sends webhook to `/api/payments/paynow/callback`
- System updates payment status
- Triggers post-payment actions (activate membership, etc.)

### 3. Status Polling
Frontend automatically polls:
```typescript
GET /api/payments/{paymentId}/status
```
Every 3 seconds until:
- Status becomes `completed` ‚úÖ
- Status becomes `failed` or `cancelled` ‚ùå
- 5 minutes timeout ‚è±Ô∏è

### Payment Not Initiating

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify environment
echo $PAYNOW_INTEGRATION_ID
# Should output: 21044

# Check server logs
# Look for "PayNow initiation error" messages
```

### Mobile Prompt Not Received
**Check:**
- Phone number format: `+263771234567`
- Mobile money account is active
- Phone has network connection
- Account has sufficient balance

**Solution:**
Try web redirect method instead by leaving phone number empty.

### Status Not Updating
**Check:**
- Webhook URL is accessible
- Payment was actually completed
- Polling is still running (check console)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually check payment status
curl http://localhost:5002/api/payments/{paymentId}/status
```

### Webhook Not Working
**Check:**
- Result URL is publicly accessible
- Firewall allows incoming connections
- Server is running and reachable

**For Development:**
Use tools like ngrok to expose local server:
```bash
ngrok http 5002
# Update PAYNOW_RESULT_URL to ngrok URL
```
