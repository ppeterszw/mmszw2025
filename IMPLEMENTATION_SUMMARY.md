    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    credentials: 'include',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: 500,
      currency: 'USD',
      paymentMethod: 'paynow_ecocash',
      purpose: 'subscription',
      description: 'Annual membership subscription',
      memberId: user.memberId,
      phoneNumber: '+263771234567',
      email: user.email,
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  if (data.success) {
    if (data.paynow.method === 'redirect') {
      // Redirect to PayNow
      window.location.href = data.paynow.redirectUrl;
    } else {
      // Express checkout - show instructions
      showInstructions(data.paynow.instructions);
      // Start polling
      pollPaymentStatus(data.payment.id);
    }
  }
};
```

### Polling Payment Status

```typescript
const pollPaymentStatus = async (paymentId: string) => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/payments/${paymentId}/status`, {
      credentials: 'include',
    });
    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.payment.status === 'completed') {
      clearInterval(interval);
      showSuccess();
      refreshPage();
    } else if (data.payment.status === 'failed') {
      clearInterval(interval);
      showError();
    }
  }, 3000); // Poll every 3 seconds
