# Member-Organization Assignment Feature
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed and Deployed

---

## Problem Statement

Members in the admin dashboard showed "Independent" for the organization column, even though some members should have been assigned to organizations.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Part 1: Immediate Fix (SQL Scripts)

**Created Scripts:**
- `scripts/assign-members-to-organizations.sql` - SQL commands to assign members
- `scripts/assign-members.sh` - Bash wrapper for easy execution

**Results:**
```
BEFORE: 5 unassigned members, 4 assigned members
AFTER:  0 unassigned members, 9 assigned members (100% assigned!)
```

**Member Assignments:**
| Member | Organization |
|--------|-------------|
| Sarah Ndlovu | BYO Real Estate |
| David Moyo | Premier Estate Agents |
| Phillip Peter (ppeterszw) | Harare Property Management |
| Arie Ben | BYO Real Estate |
| Phillip Peter (commerzbank) | Premier Estate Agents |
| John Chikwanha | Premier Estate Agents |
| Grace Mukamuri | Premier Estate Agents |
| Tendai Moyo | Harare Property Management |
| Chipo Mutumwa | Zimbabwe Brokerage Services |

### Part 2: Backend API

**New Endpoints:**

1. **GET /api/admin/members** - Enhanced to return members WITH organization data
   - Uses SQL LEFT JOIN to include organization info
   - Returns `{ ...member, organization: { name, registrationNumber, ... } }`

2. **PUT /api/admin/members/:id/assign-organization** - Assign/unassign organizations
   - Request body: `{ organizationId: "uuid" }` or `{ organizationId: null }`
   - Validates organization exists before assignment
   - Updates member record and returns success/error

**New Storage Methods:**
```typescript
getAllMembersWithOrganizations(): Promise<MemberWithOrganization[]>
```

### Part 3: Frontend UI

**Enhanced Member Management Page:**

1. **Organization Column** - Now displays actual organization names
   - Shows organization name or "Independent" if unassigned
   - Visible in main members table

2. **Member Detail Modal** - Shows organization in Professional Information section
   - Read-only display of current organization

3. **Assign Organization Dialog** ✨ NEW
   - Beautiful modal with purple/pink gradient theme
   - Shows current organization
   - Dropdown to select new organization (active organizations only)
   - Option to remove assignment ("Independent Practitioner")
   - Real-time validation and error handling
   - Success toast notifications

**UI Flow:**
1. Click on any member in the table → Opens detail modal
2. Click "Assign Organization" button → Opens assignment modal
3. Select organization from dropdown (or "Independent Practitioner")
4. Click "Assign Organization" → Updates in real-time
5. Success toast notification → Member detail modal closes
6. Table refreshes automatically with new organization

## Technical Details

### Database Changes
No schema changes needed - the `organization_id` field already existed in the `members` table.

### API Integration
```typescript
// Fetch members with organizations
const { data: members } = useQuery<MemberWithOrganization[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/admin/members"],
});

// Fetch available organizations
const { data: organizations } = useQuery<Organization[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/organizations"],
});

// Assign organization mutation
const assignOrganizationMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: ({ memberId, organizationId }) =>
    apiRequest("PUT", `/api/admin/members/${memberId}/assign-organization`,
      { organizationId }),
  onSuccess: () => {
    // Refresh members list
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["/api/admin/members"] });
  }
});
```

### SQL Query (Backend)
```typescript
// Get members with organizations (LEFT JOIN)
const results = await db
  .select({
    member: members,
    organization: organizations
  })
  .from(members)
  .leftJoin(organizations, eq(members.organizationId, organizations.id))
  .orderBy(desc(members.createdAt));

return results.map(row => ({
  ...row.member,
  organization: row.organization || null
}));
```

## How to Use

### For Admins (Via UI)

1. **View Organization Assignments:**
   - Go to Admin Dashboard → Members
   - Organization column shows current assignment

2. **Assign/Change Organization:**
   - Click on any member row
   - Click "Assign Organization" button (purple gradient)
   - Select organization from dropdown
   - Click "Assign Organization" to confirm

3. **Remove Organization Assignment:**
   - Follow steps 1-2 above
   - Select "Independent Practitioner (No Organization)"
   - Click "Assign Organization" to confirm

### Via SQL (Bulk Operations)

To assign multiple members at once:

```sql
-- Assign multiple members to one organization
UPDATE members
SET organization_id = 'organization-uuid-here'
WHERE membership_number IN (
  'EAC-MBR-2025-0001',
  'EAC-MBR-2025-0002'
);
```

Or use the provided script:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
./scripts/assign-members.sh
```

### Via API (Programmatic)

```bash
# Assign organization
curl -X PUT https://mms.estateagentscouncil.org/api/admin/members/:memberId/assign-organization \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"organizationId": "uuid-of-organization"}'

# Remove organization
curl -X PUT https://mms.estateagentscouncil.org/api/admin/members/:memberId/assign-organization \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"organizationId": null}'
```
